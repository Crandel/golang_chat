# Websocket chat written on golang

In this project I try to understand, how to create web apps using golang.

There are so many examples about creating simple chats, but unfortunately to little about creating complex web solutions with autentication and config management, etc.

So in this project I try to discribe as many different web problem solving, as I can.
